"""
BITMASK: a way of representing a set of bits (0s and 1s) and is used for efficiently manipulating individual bits of numbers efficiently
XOR: an operation where given a and b are bits, a XOR b flips the bits when a and b differ
Notation in python:
"^": XOR operation
"&": AND operation
"|": OR operation
a << b: left shift. shifts the bits of a by b, effectively multiplying by a powers of 2
